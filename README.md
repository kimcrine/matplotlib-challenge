# matplotlib-challenge
In this challenge, I was provided with a study of 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth that were treated with a variety of drug regimens. My goal was to create summary data to assess how each drug regimen performed and what factors contributed to tumor growth. I began by checking for duplicate mice and removing any duplicated data from the set. I then created a bar chart to examine how many mice were treated with each regiment throughout the study. I created a pie chart to compare the distrivution of male and female mice in the study. The study showed promising results for four of the regimens: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol and Ceftamin. By calculating the quartiles and IQR and generating a box and whisker plot, I was able to identify potential outliers across the top four treatment regimens. I took a sample mouse that was treated with Capomulin to see its tumor volume over time as it was treated. In a scatter plot, I showed the correlation between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment.
